# Extracting-Attention-from-EEG-signals

In the Main folder, main codes for the extracting attention index using the novel Neural network architecture has provided. The files in the extra folder are needed to run these code, so they should be added to the same directory the main codes have saved. The dimension reduction folder includes the files for running Multi Kernel Learning with the help of support Vectors dimension Reduction on the dataset.
